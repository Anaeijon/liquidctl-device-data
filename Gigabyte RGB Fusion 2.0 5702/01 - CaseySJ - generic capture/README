1. (original file has since been replaced with filtered version) ~~When examining this capture file in WireShark, apply the filer: usb.device_address == 5. This will show only the USB traffic to and from the RGB Fusion 2.0 controller.~~

2. This file records USB traffic generated by Gigabyte’s RGB Fusion 2.0 application running in Windows 10 on a Gigabyte Z490 Vision D motherboard. Although the RGB Fusion 2.0 driver supports both controller types 0x5702 and 0x8297, this capture is from the 0x5702 controller. This traffic may be identical to that from a 0x8297 controller.

3. This capture file does not record every lighting mode. It is not a comprehensive capture, but does capture the basics. Note that this driver exclusively uses “get_feature_report” and “send_feature_report”. It does not use “read” and “write”.
