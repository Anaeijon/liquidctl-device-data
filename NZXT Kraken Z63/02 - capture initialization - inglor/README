Accompanying notes from @inglor:

 - If you don't have installed the NZXT CAM version or you start from a cold
   start (shutdown, power-off the PSU for 10 seconds and power on and start
   windows/linux) the Kraken Z63 displays the current Liquid temperature in
   white text (default orientation).
 - Once you start the NZXT CAM in windows it updates the LCD screen with what
   you've configured in the CAM settings and adds the colors.
 - The default "profile" of the Z63 without CAM is to have both pump and fans
   set to silent profile and it doesn't spin up or down while stressing the
   CPU. The Liquid temperature after a few cinebenches goes up to 31 C from 29
   C and max CPU temp from motherboard is around 70 C for my setup (AMD 3950x).
 - If you shut down the CAM in windows the LCD screen stays static. It doesn't
   update but just shows the latest update from when CAM was running, which
   leads to me believe the LCD is pretty dump and just calculates the next
   frame and shows it.
 - If you restart of do a soft shutdown (no power down of the PSU) the Kraken
   Z63 shows the latest static image from the last time CAM was running - I
   assume this will be the same if you dual boot to linux after windows, but
   haven't tried it yet.
 - If you start CAM the fans and pump seems to be monitoring CPU temperature as
   I see them spin up when running a bentchmark and spin down after it
   finishes. It's not ideal and I'd rather monitor the Liquid temperature
 - After various attempts on the Wireshark to capture the USB data I've finally
   got some data.  This is from a cold reboot to starting and closing CAM
   software so I presume the initiallization process and a few updates on CPU
   temp.
