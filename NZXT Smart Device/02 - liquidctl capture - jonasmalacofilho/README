This capture shows traffic between the device and the Windows/Linux kernels,
liquidctl, and (my) grdp3 kernel module (on Linux).  This does *not* show the
initialization procedure performed by CAM.  Check packet comments for specific
actions performed at each point in time.

The objective was to investigate liquidctl issue 182 ("OSError: open failed on
NZXT Smart Device (V1) on my hackintosh").[1]

Specifically, I was looking into what could explain why an uninitialized
`status` on Windows would be enough to make the device work on Mac OS.[2]
